tetmag documentation
=====================

tetmag is a micromagnetic finite-element simulation software.
It simulates the magnetization field and its evolution in time in three-dimensional ferromagnetic nanostructures of arbitrary shape.
As a general-purpose micromagnetic solver, tetmag can treat a large
variety of standard tasks in micromagnetic simulations, such as calculating
static magnetization textures, hysteresis loops, dynamic switching processes,
magnetic high-frequency oscillations, or the current-driven magnetization dynamics.

By exploiting advanced data compression methods, highly efficient solvers and
integrators, as well as GPU acceleration, tetmag is suitable for
high-performance computations and large-scale micromagnetic simulations.
